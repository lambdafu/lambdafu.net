      <p class="abstract">
	I wrote a review of the Sound Blaster Live! sound card,
	but it should not be understood as an objective test report.
	For such a report I am lacking the technical prerequisites and knowledge
	about sound technic. A strong emphasis is laid on the
        accompanying software, and even for this reason only the report is
        certainly subjectiv and unbalanced.

      </ul>
      <h3><a name="installation">Installation</a></h3>
      <h4>First Impression</h4>
      <p>
        The Sound Blaster Live! is a surprisingly small card. First,
        one realizes that there are no memory sockets on the card any more,
        because the card shares memory on the motherboard with the processor
        and all applications.  Second, it is a PCI card, which means
        that it does not use ISA PnP technology.
      <p>
        Furthermore, the card is accompanied by a smaller board with
        additional connectors - not all connectors fit in one single
        slot. So, the sound card uses up two slots of the case,
        although it does only occupy one PCI slot on the motherboard.
      <p>
      <h4>Hardware Installation</h4>
      <p>
        Pushing the card in the PCI slot needed a lot of pressure, but
        eventually it fit.  Connecting the smaller board with the
        additional connectors to the main board and installing both in
        the case was no problem, although I only have a mini
        case. Because the card is small and very short, it will not
        hang through, and I'm sure I'll not experience deformations of
        the board as it happened with the Sound Blaster 32 PnP.
      <h4>Software Installation</h4>
      <p>
        After booting Windows 95, the automatic hardware detection
        asked for a driver. I tried to use the Installation CD, but it
        failed. The hardware detection at boot time had to be aborted,
        and the installation had to be continued later, a fact that may
        be confusing to a beginner but probably does not surprise a
        more advanced user.
      <p>
        So, I aborted the auto detection and let Windows 95 complete
        the boot procedure. Then I inserted the Installation CD.
        Because I do not use the auto start feature, I started the
        installation program manually. It came up, and I was faced
        with a list of software items to choose from.
      <p>
      <ul><p>The list of software items at installation time</p>
        <li>CT SB Live!
        <li><a href="#keytar">CT Keytar</a>
        <li>CT Rythmania
        <li><a href="#experience">SB Live Experience</a>
        <li><a href="#cakewalk">Cakewalk Express Gold</a>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first item is the hardware driver plus additional
        utilities, and is the only item which is mandatory. To install
        it, 56 MB free disk space are required, a fact that was quite
        disturbing to me, but unfortunately common in the Windows
        world. Although prizes for hard disks are decreasing, I'd
        appreciate it if software developers would care more about the
        size of the programs. The 56 MB are not a big deal, but if you
        add the size of the operating system and the required drivers
        for all hardware items installed, the complete size is
        unappealing to me. Another reason is that a lot of RAM will be
        wasted at run time. I'll come back later to this topic, when
        discussing the applications.
      <p>
        Direct X is needed, and will be installed automatically. As
        this is a component mostly independent from the sound card, it
        would be better to make this a seperate step, or at least ask
        for confirmation. In general I would prefer a more flexible
        way to choose components for installation, although I realize
        that the table above is ideal for unexperienced users.
      <p>
        After the necessary reboot, a Readme text was offered, which I
        investigated.  As I have only a Pentium 100 MHz, the install
        program asked me for confirmation if I really want to proceed,
        as a Pentium with at least 200 MHz is recommended.
        Nevertheless I chose to continue.
      <p>
        Then, RUNDLL32 caused an error due to an invalid memory page
        in module KERNEL32.DLL. Fortunately I could ignore the error
        without impact on the installation. At least I could not
        detect any errors yet.  An experienced user is used to random
        errors in Windows, but a beginner will certainly feel uneasy
        with this.
      <h4>Facit</h4>
      <p>
        The installation is easy enough even for an unexperienced
        user, but an experienced user will miss the possibility to
        choose between smaller components. The installation went
        smoothly, although I encountered a few edges which may be seen
        as a real problem by beginners.
      <h3><a name="hardware">Hardware</a></h3>
      <h4>Boards</h4>
      <p>
        The Sound Blaster Live! consists of two boards, a PCI card and
        a smaller extension card providing additional connectors.
      <p>
        The board uses the PCI bus, which was necessary because the
        amount of data that has to be transmitted has increased with
        DirectSound by Microsoft and the use of multiple streams of
        audio. Hence, the change to a PCI bus architecture was
        necessary for Creative Labs to cope with the performance
        needs.
      <p>
        However, despite the difference in bus architecture, the SB
        Live! card should be backward compatible to prior Sound
        Blaster cards even under DOS.
      <h4>Connectors</h4>
      <p>
        Some connectors are placed on the card, some are at the
        outside and some on the extension card.
      <ul><p>The connectors of the SB Live! card
        <li>Microphone in
        <li>Digital CD in
        <li>Line in
        <li>Telephone Answering Device in
        <li>Line level out (front)
        <li>RCA S/PDIF in
        <li>Line level out (rear)
        <li>RCA S/PDIF out
        <li><a href="#joystick">Joystick port</a>
        <li><a href="#midi">Mini MIDI DIN in/out</a>
        <li>MPC-3 CD Audio in
        <li>Auxiliary in
        <li>Digital DIN out for future expansion to multi-speaker systems
      </ul>
      <h5><a name="joystick">Joystick port</a></h5>
      <p>
        The Joystick port can be used to attach a PC analog joystick
        to the computer. MIDI cables which are connected to the
        joystick port using a special adapter cable also work,
        although you may prefer to use the <a href="#midi">mini MIDI
        DIN interfaces</a> for this.
      <h5><a name="midi">Mini MIDI DIN</a></h5>
      <p>
        Midi in and midi out are placed at the extension card and can
        be used to attach MIDI devices to the SB Live! card, makes it
        a good card for MIDI recording and playing. A converter for
        normal sized MIDI DIN plugs is provided with the card. This
        makes the special joystick adapter cable unnecessary, which
        had to be used with earlier Sound Blaster cards.
      <h4><a name="emu">Emu 10K1</a></h4>
      <p>
        The Emu 10K1 is the nerve of the SB Live! card, an audio
        processor with over two millions transistors and more than
        1,000 MIPS of raw processing power. The chip provides 131
        hardware audio channels.
      <ul><p>The channels of the EMU 10K1
        <li><a href="#audio">64 Sound Engine channels</a>
        <li>32 Host Record channels
        <li>2 Stereo Sample-Rate-Converted Record Channels
        <li>1 Single Microphone 8 kHz Sample-Rate-Converted Host Record Channel
        <li>32 External TRAM 32 reads or writes for effects engine, delay lines for reverbs etc.
      </ul>
      <h5><a name="audio">Audio Channels</a></h5>
      <p>
        The 64 audio channels are dedicated to output sounds, and can
        be played back at an arbitrary sample rate. But each of these
        channels can also be used as a Wavetable synthesizer in
        addition of the 192 voices of the PCI wave-table synthesis.
        The audio channels process signals at 32-bit, 192
        dB, 48kHz using 8-point interpolation to smoothen the sound.
        This makes the Sound Blaster card highly useful to record and
        play audio sources with CD quality.
      <p>
        The hardware does support full duplex at 8 standard sample
        rates.
      <h5>Effects</h5>
      <p>
        The Emu 10K1 is also responsible for the effects that can be
        applied to the sound sources. Real time effects such as echo,
        flanger, pitch shifting, auto-wah, ring modulator, distortion,
        reverb and chorus can be combined and configured, allowing a
        wide variety of distinct sound transformations.  Effects can
        be routed into each other, which allows a fine control of what
        happens to the sound.
      <p>
        You can use the effect engine of the SB Live!  for many
        things, including as an effect processor for musical
        instruments (like a guitar), as a pitch shifter for karaoke,
        or to enhance digital audio or midi tracks.
      <p>
        The Emu 10K1 operates as a DirectSound accelerator, and can
        accelerate up to 64 high quality 16-bit 48kHz audio streams
        and 32 DirectSound 3D streams.  Furthermore, it can still
        apply <a href="#envaudio">Environmental Audio</a> to all of
        these and deliver the streams to multiple speakers. This shows
        how much processing power is included in the Emu 10K1 chip.
      <p>
        The 256 voices can be used with 48 MIDI channels on three MIDI
        ports, allowing the composer to forget about the hardware
        limitations and concentrate on the music instead.
      <h4>Speakers</h4>
      <p>
        The SoundBlaster Live! sound card allows the use of two or
        four speakers to produce surround sound of high quality. If
        only two speakers are connected, the card tries to emulate 3D
        sound on those as good as possible, but the best result is
        achieved when four speakers are connected to the card.
      <p>
        It is possible to position the sound of an audio source in the
        virtual space created by four speakers using the <a
        href="#speaker">speaker configuration software</a>.
      <p>
        In the future, software updates will make it possible to use
        up to eight speakers with the SB Live! card.
      <h4>Digital I/O</h4>
      <p>
        The extension card features not only two mini MIDI connectors,
        but also digital S/PDIF input/output as well as a digital DIN
        connector. The latter will make it possible to connect up to
        eight speakers to the card.
      <p>
        The S/PDIF connectors make it possible to connect S/PDIF
        compatible digital audio devices to the sound card for digital
        audio recording and playback.  S/PDIF complatible devices are
        for example DAT player. Users can also connect their CD-ROM
        drive to the CD Digital-In connector on the card if their CD
        ROM player is S/PDIF compatible. This way, they can record the
        digital audio data directly.
      <h4>Music Synthesis</h4>
      <p>
        The SB LIve! card allows music synthesis with up to 256
        voices. Those are seperated in 192 PCI Wavetable voices and 64
        voices from the <a href="#emu">Emu 10K1</a> itself. This
        allows the use of an increased number of MIDI instruments at
        the same time. Now you can use the sustain pedal in your midi
        works without being afraid that prior notes are chopped off
        due to a limited number of midi voices.
      <p>
        To use MIDI music, you need to load a SoundFont in the RAM of
        the host machine. Up to 32 MB RAM can be dedicated to the SB
        LIve! to be used for SoundFonts. Provided are 2 MB, 4 MB and 8
        MB default SoundFonts (GM compatible). Additional SoundFonts
        can be purchased and easily installed using the <a
        href="#soundfont">SoundFont configuration</a> program.
      <h4>Facit</h4>
      <p>
        The hardware of the SB Live! card is excellent, and usable for
        both, entertainment and productivity. The complete set of
        interfaces to external devices, the number of high quality
        audio channels and the high number of midi channels and voices
        show how usable the SB Live! card is for music recording and
        composing. The Environmental Audio and DirectSound3D support,
        as well as the possibility to connect up to eight speakers
        prove the usability of the card for entertainment.
      <h3><A href="#software">Software</a></h3>
      <p>
        The Sound Blaster Live! is only useful in conjunction with
        software to control its features. Fortunately, the driver
        ships with powerful and easy-to-use software for this purpose.

<H5><A NAME="launcher">Creative Launcher</A></H5>
<P>
The Launcher is an application that is started at boot time and sits in
the background, waiting for the mouse to move to the top of the screen. When
this happens, a menu scrolls down and gives the user the option to start an
application shipped with the Sound Blaster Live! card. This is a very fast
way to start the applications, but the drawbacks are easily identified.</P>
<P>
First, you have to watch your mouse movements, or you'll make the menu appear by
accident, which is at least irritating, but also either occupies expensive
RAM or causes a small delay while the data is loaded from the swap space.
Furthermore, this is far beyond the tasks I'd expect hardware driver
software to fulfill. Personally, I like to choose the way I organize my
desktop by myself.</P>
<P>
However, some people may be happy that they can go right ahead with the
sound card applications, and the launcher is very flexible. You can configure
it quite easily, and add your own programs to the menu. Because it is also
very easy to deactivate, it does no harm that it is installed by default.</P>
<P>
The launcher can be configured to wait above the top border of the screen
or below the bottom border. It can show symbols and text or only text, stay
always on top and start automatically at boot time (and in this case, doesn't
clutter up the autostart menu). The auto hide function can be switched off.
You can add new menus and edit existing menus using the Group Manager.</P>

<H5><A NAME="playcenter">PlayCenter</A></H5>
<P>
The PlayCenter replaces the earlier Creative MultiMediaDesk, and can play
all commonly used audio formats and more (video, for example). It has the
functionality to collect audio files in albums, which is very useful to
organize your collection of sounds, midi files etc.</P>
<P>
Beside the usual control elements for player applications (Play, Stop,
Pause, Forward, Rewind, Next, Previous, number pad, various playing modes
like Loop and Shuffle), the player allows direct access to two Sound Blaster
Live! features, namely <A HREF="#envaudio">Environmental Audio</A> and
Stereo Enchancement Mode. The latter can only be switched on or off,
whereas the former offers a menu containing the defined environments.</P>
<P>
The PlayCenter can play Media files directly out of the file system or
from albums, which are collections of media files. You can create and edit
the albums as you like. A function to auto create initial albums
using the media files found in your file system is provided, although the
result should be edited to make them more useful.</P>
<P>
The PlayCenter will run about any audio and video media  you can
find. Sometimes, special system libraries are required that you most probably
already have. With a special PC-DVD disk drive you can even play DVD disks
comfortably. As I don't own such a disk, I couldn't test it, but the
explanations in the help file look very promising.</P>
<P>
The Look and Feel is modelled after a black metal hifi device. The same
functionality could be offered by a more conventional interface, without
a faked LCD display and the use of many colors. The grey shaded pull down
menus are simply ugly and have a very low contrast, which makes them hard to
read. I always wonder why great efforts are spent in the appearance of the
driver software is made. The SB Live! is technically convincing and does not
need additional gleam.
This is not only a matter of taste: Sometimes the colors of the launcher window
are not restored properly in 256-colors (8 bit) mode.</P>
<P>
The Launcher will play the media files in one album consecutively, without
a break between the various file. This is not only disturbing, because there
is no pause for the ear to prepare for a new sound, but also an error, because
various Midi files last notes are not played long enough. I did not find an option
to introduce a delay between two media files.</P>

<H5><A NAME="wavestudio">Creative WaveStudio</A></H5>
<P>
The WaveStudio application is a wave recorder and processor. It can record
many wave files at the same time in three different sample rates. You can play back
single files (even from a special point, skipping the beginning) or selected parts
of it. You can play back all files and mix them, which can be fun. But there
is no easy way to get all files in sync, as you can't play existing files while
recording another one.</P>
<P>
You can apply effects to the recordings. All important effects are there,
namely Reverse, Fading, Panning, Echo, Phase Shift and some basic channel editing
features.</P>
<P>
However, there is a serious problem: There is no record volume indicator,
which means, you can't control the input gain of your source correctly. This
makes this program completely unusable for serious recording efforts and seems
to be a bug in the application, as a volume indicator is mentioned in the help file.
It is just nowhere to be found.</P>

<H5><A NAME="soundole">Soundo'LE</A></H5>
<P>
Soundo'LE is a very simple wave recorder with OLE support, to embed wave
recordings in other applications (e.g. WordPad). Again, although a volume
indicator is present in the window, it does not seem to work.</P>
<P>
There is a better application to do wave recording professionally.
<A HREF="#soundforge">SoundForge XP</A> on the Applications CD
is an advanced audio recording program (with a working volume monitor,
by the way :).</P>

<H5><A NAME="mixer">Mixer</A></H5>
<P>
The mixer is used to control the volume level of the sound card in
general and the seperate devices in particular. The Sound Blaster Live!
mixer is very clear and easy to use, as was every Sound Blaster mixer
before.</P>

<H5><A NAME="tour">SB Live! Tour</A></H5>
<P>
The SB Live! Tour is a set of Screencam movies which demonstrate some
ways to work with the SB Live! software.</P>

<H5><A NAME="experience">SB Live! Experience</A></H5>
<P>
The SB Live! Experience is a guided demonstration of the features of the SB Live!
card. It is an interactive demonstration and it is recommended to try it
after installation to get an impression of the capabilities of the card.</P>
<P>
Indeed, the demonstraction is quite impressive, and you can go and show it
to your friends. After that, you may want to deinstall the Tour program
again, because it is occupying a lot of disc space.</P>

<H5><A NAME="envaudio">Environmental Audio</A></H5>
<P>
Environmental Audio makes the SB Live! an ideal card for games: It adds
effects to the sound dynamically, and increases the atmosphere. But not
only games can benefit from Environmental Audio. You can apply the effects
to all audio sources you can use with the SB Live!.</P>
<P>
The Environmental Audio option window provides a way to apply effects
to the audio sources. Predefined environments are ready for selection, but
you can also design your own audio environments and save them for later use.
Beside multiple Reverb and Chorus effects, you can also add Vocal Morpher,
Ring Modulator, Auto Wah, Flanger, Distortion, Echo and Pitch Shifter.
Each effect can be configured seperately in amount.</P>
<P>
The problem with conventional 3D positioning sound is that although the
position of the sound seems to be correct, it does not take into account the
surrounding space. For example, a sound in a cave does sound quite different
if it is near or far away. The difference is not only the volume, but also
the amount of echo, reverb and other characteristics.</P>
<P>
To deal with this problem, the software had to provide many samples of the
same sound with different characteristics. This eats up a lot of disc space
and is very expensive.</P>
<P>
Environmental Audio provides another solution for this. The driver software
can be configured to take into account sound-modifying characteristics of the
surrounding space, resulting in a more realistic sound experience.</P>
<P>
Software can benefit in two ways of the Environmental Audio features
provided by the SB Live! cards. The first way effects existing software that
is not aware of Environmental Audio. In this case, the user can specify an
environment before the game is started. Although the enhancement is limited
this way, you can improve the atmosphere of your favourite game or other
audio source.</P>
<P>
New software will be able to make use of the Environmental Audio Extensions
(EAX), a Environmental 3D positioning API by Creative Labs. This development
software is an extension to the DirectSound3D API by Microsoft. As the
latter is the standard API used by game developers using 3D positional audio
games, many games will make use of the SB Live! features very soon.</P>
<P>
There is already one game which is aware of Environmental Audio, the game
Unreal by Epic Games. Others will
follow soon. According to George Thorn, director of developer relations at
Creative Labs, over 100 developers are already working with EAX, and 30
titles currently under development are actually using it.</P>

<H5><A NAME="keyboard">Creative Keyboard</A></H5>
<P>
Creative Keyboard is a simple application to test the sounds of your
installed MIDI banks. It is a virtual keyboard to be played with the
mouse, and is derived from the virtual keyboard of the AWE control center
shipped with the AWE cards. Unfortunately, you still can't use the computer
keyboard to play the notes, but some other things have improved, for example
the octave  and controller setting lever.</P>

<H5><A NAME="keytar">Creative Keytar</A></H5>
<P>
Creative Guitar is a fun program that allows the user to choose among a set
of guitars (ranging from Folk Guitar over Jazz Guitar to Electric Guitars)
and play them using the mouse or the keyboard.</P>
<P>
Using the mouse, you move a plectrum over the strings, holding the mouse
buttons down. The strings run from top to bottom, so you have to move the
mouse from left to right. You can imagine that no fast play of single
strings is possible.</P>
<P>
Using the keyboard, you hold it in your hand vertically, the keys outside.
On the function keys, you can choose the chords with your left hand. On the
number pad, you can play the bass string and the three chord strings.
Changing the chords is a bit tricky, because on PC keyboards, some keys
block other keys, and you can't press more than four keys anyway. Although
this works a bit better than using the mouse, it does not give you fine
control over what is happening.</P>
<P>
There are some configuration options, for example the chords which are set
with the function keys, the midi instruments used, and the position of the
string keys on the number pad. There are some background rythm you can sue
for accompaning your solos.</P>
<P>
However, this is neither a replacement for a real guitar nor a tool to
produce audio recordings, as no export facilites are provided.</P>

<H5><A NAME="graph">Creative SoundGraph</A></H5>
<P>
The Creative SoundGraph is a small applet that shows the spectrum, amplitude
or wave curve of the sounds currently recorded or played. This can be useful
if you want to check your audio setup. For example, if you can't hear
anything, you can first test if a sound is produced before examining your
speaker connection. Or, you can see if the volume settings are well
balanced.</P>

<H5><A NAME="soundfont">SoundFont</A></H5>
<P>
The SoundFont window makes it possible for you to choose the MIDI sound font
banks you want to load into your memory. They are used to generate the MIDI sounds
via the WaveFont device.</P>
<P>
The SB Live! ships with three banks, different in size and therefore
quality. You can choose between 2 MB, 4 MB and 8 MB soundfont banks. These
default banks are GM Midi compatible and provide the standard set of GM
instruments.
</P>
<P>You can either load complete sound font banks, or define the instruments
of a bank explicitely. Furthermore, you can load a wave file to be used
as an instrument.</P>

<H5><A NAME="speaker">Speaker</A></H5>
<P>
In the speaker setup window, you can specify how many speakers are used (you can
use up to 8 speakers). Furthermore, you can place the various sound sources
in the virtual room to get flexible surround sound as you like it.</P>

<h3>Applications</h3>
<P>
The Sound Blaster Live! is accompanied by a rich software bundled, featuring
some excellent sound applications as well as some not-so-excellent add-ons
to play with. The documentation is included on the CD in Acrobats PDF .
The Acrobat Reader itself is also contained.</P>

<H5><A NAME="soundforge">SoundForge XP 4.0</A></H5>
<P>SoundForge XP by Sonic Foundry is an advanced audio recording program, much better
than <A HREF="#wavestudio">WaveStudio</A> that is installed with the driver.
It offers a complex but easy to use recording and editing suite and extensive
online help with many background information about sound processing.</P>
<P>
With SoundForge, you can process multiple wave files at the same time.
To record a source, a special window is opened, which offers a volume and peak
monitor as well as flexible recording options, for example, how long you
want to record (this is useful to overwrite only a part of an existing recording).</P>
<P>
SoundForge provides convenient display and edit options, including but not limited
to Zoom, Cut & Paste, Mix, Crossfade as well as cuseful Undo and Redo features.
You can place Markers in a file at anywhere and use them to specify regions of audio data.</P>
<P>
Many ways to process the audio data are provided. You can fade, mute, invert, normalize,
pan, convert between audio formats, smooth and enhance the audio source. Furthermore, a
special function allows to change the length of a sample without affecting the pitch. This does
work quite good, as long as you stay within reasonable durations. Stretching the length
of a sample to 120% of its original size is reasonable. Speech can be stretched up to 140% of its
original length. If you go further, you get a distorted sound, which can give quite
interesting results.</P>
<P>
Many effects can be applied to the samples, namely Chorus, Delay/Echo, Distortion,
Dynamics, Flange, Noise Gate, Pitch Bend and Reverb. Some of these names hide multiple
similar effects, some of them are highly configurable. For example, for the Pitch Bend
effect you can draw a curve diagramm to specify the amount of pitching at each time.</P>
<P>
A tone generator allows you to generate sine curves of a certain length,
frequency and volume, but also square, saw, triangle and noise waveforms.
Even DTMF/MF dial tones can be generated. Last but not least you can attach
an AVI movie and synchronize the pictures with the audio samples.</P>
<P>
SoundForge is a high-quality addition to your audio production software
collection. It is highly configurable and flexible, but nevertheless easy and
comfortable to use. All important elements are directly accessible, and so you
can get good results very fast. The good online documentation makes it a perfect
environment for audio recording and editing.</P>

<H5><A NAME="mixmanstudio">Mixman Studio</A></H5>
<P>
Mixman Studio by Mixman Technologies is a fast way to create techno mixes and similar
noise. It makes available up to sixteen tracks with keys on your keyboard,
and in a special mix mode the tracks are played if you press down those keys.
You can tag certain tracks with the space bar, so they are played even when you unrelease
the key. Pressing the Ctrl key, you enter the "solo mode", where all tagged tracks are silent
until you release the Ctrl key again. In this way, you can mix techno songs and alike
very fast and conveniently.</P>
<P>
As there are no editing capabilities, it is not useful for serious sound composing.
Obviously, this program is intended to be fun for people who want to play their own techno
sounds without learning much about music and music recording. For this group, Mixman Studio
is a nice program to play with.</P>
<P>
For this sort of programs, it is very important that they are accompanied by many tracks to
include in a mix. Mixman Studio comes with about 80 tracks, a random selection of bass lines,
harmonics and drum breaks for techno, house and other scene music styles. People who want
to use this softwware seriously will need to buy additional tracks on CD, 80 will not
give enough variety to mix the songs you want to.</P>
<P>
Another solution is to record your own tracks, or to use existing .wav files, which is
supported by Mixman Studio. However, one concern is that you usually can't achieve high
quality recordings with home equipment. However, it is good and important that these import
facilities are there. Additionally, you can save the complete mix as one
huge wave file and share it with your friends. Well, if you have enough disk space at least:
The demo mix that comes with Mixman Studio would take over 30 MB to save as a .wav file :)</P>

<H5><A NAME="cakewalk">Cakewalk Express Gold</A></H5>
<P>
Cakewalk Express Gold is a full-featured midi sequencer and notation
software. To cover all the capabilities of Cakewalk Express Gold would
certainly not fit in this review. Beside midi recording and playback
facilities, Cakewalk can also play up to 4 audio tracks parallel to
the midi tracks.</P>
<P>
Together with <A HREF="#soundforge">SoundForge</A>, Cakewalk provides an
ideal base for your home composing efforts with the SB Live! card.</P>
<P>
Cakewalk Express Gold is aware of the
<A HREF="#soundfont">SoundFont</A> capabilities of the SB Live!
card.</P>

<H5><A NAME="prodyparrot">Prody Parrot</A></H5>
<P>
Prody Parrot is most likely the worst software in the bundle. It features
a talking parrot, controlled by speech recognition, in the loosest sense of
the term.</P>
<P>
The parrot is actually a small animated graphic which is flying around,
sitting on windows frames and annyoing the user from time to time
with his unintelligent comments. The comments are generated from text files
by Text Assist, the text-to-speech software that was already bundled with the
AWE cards. Unfortunately, it has hardly improved since then. Most advertised
feature added in this version is an email filter, which should be able to
read emails without confusing the listener by spelling each control character.
But, Text Assist is still an insult to the ear and human language. The intonation
is hardly correct, and the voice melody is so wrong that it is not only annoying, but
often also confusing.</P>
<P>
The language recognition is done by Voice Assist and seems to work most of the time.
I didn't spend much time to train the recognition algorithm, it worked surprisingly
good out of the box, and I assume it works even better for a native english speaker.
You can bind actions to certain phrases, which control windowing functions or start
applications on request. Beside spoken language, Voice Assist can interpret keyboard
commands and even mouse movements. The latter is disabled by default, and should be
used carefully if at all.</P>
<P>
Everytime I started these applications, I wondered if they can be useful for anyone
at all. Visually challenged people won't use TextAssist, because real text-to-speech
engines are implemented in hardware and give much better results. People who want to
use a microphone to work with the computer will buy serious dictating software which
does not cost too much these days. The parrot is actually more useless then the Paper
Clip in Word 97. If somebody uses one of these applications for their daily work,
please let me know! Maybe there is some field of endeavor which I don't know
and where these applications are useful.</P>
