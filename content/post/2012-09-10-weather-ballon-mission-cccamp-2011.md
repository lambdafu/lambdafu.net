Amazingly, the lost weather balloon from our hacker space was found in a tree in Poland one year after launching it. I was allowed to take a tiny part during the launch and attempted recovery. Thanks to the weather balloon team for that experience!

The picture was taken a couple of minutes before the ballon reached maximum height at an altitude of approximately 38km.
