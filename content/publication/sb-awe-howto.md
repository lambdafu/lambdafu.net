I wrote a document that describes how to install and run a Sound
Blaster 32 or better under an Lnux environment. The HOWTo is written
using the sgml-tools and so available in different formats.

Unfortunately, Creative Labs is not very interested in supporting the
Linux developers. The [don't release hardware
specifications](http://www.alsa-project.org/black.html#SBLIVE) for
their new card, SB Live!. Because I lost interested in their products,
the HOWTO is not maintained by me anymore. If you want to take over,
drop me an email with your intentions.
